# Practice 2.89

## the part same as the example in book

    (define (the-empty-termlist) '())

    (define (empty-termlist? term-list) (null? term-list))


## the part have to modified

    (define (adjoin-term term term-list)
      (let ((len (- (order term) (order (first-term term-list)))))
        (define (ajoin-zero-iter term-list times)
          (if (= 0 times)
              term-list
              (ajoin-iter (cons 0 term-list) (- times 1))))
        (cons (coeff term) (ajoin-zero-iter term-list len))))

    (define (first-term term-list)
      (make-term (- (length term-list) 1) (car term-list)))

    (define (rest-term term-list)
      (if (= 0 (cadr term-list))
          (rest-term (cdr term-list))
          (cdr term-list)))
