调用示例

		(for ((define i 0) (define j 0))
		     (< i 10)
		     ((set! i (+ i 1)) (set! j (+ j 2)))
		     (display i))


		(define (for? exp)
			(tagged-list? exp 'for))

		(define (for-init-seq exp)
			(cadr exp))

		(define (for-critical exp)
			(caddr exp))

		(define (for-after-loop exp)
			(cadddr exp))

		(define (for-body exp)
			(caddddr exp))

		(define (for->seq exp)
			(let ((init-seq (for-init-seq exp))
				    (critical (for-critical exp))
				    (after-loop (for-after-loop exp))
				    (body (for-body exp)))
